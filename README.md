Hi, I'm Hayden ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer with 2 years at GoDesk, where I built a helpdesk app using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Spring Boot, and MySQL. I also handled customer support, managed projects with Linear, and tracked time effectively. Iâ€™m now looking for new opportunities in software development. Outside of coding, I love playing table tennis and watching films.
