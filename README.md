Hi, I'm Hayden 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate Software Developer with experience in building and maintaining modern web applications. Over the past two years, I had the opportunity to work at GoDesk, a startup focused on developing a powerful helpdesk software solution.

🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently looking for new opportunities where I can apply my skills in web development, work with cutting-edge technologies, and contribute to impactful projects.

💼 My Experience

At GoDesk, I took on multiple roles beyond software development, contributing to the growth of the product and the company. I worked primarily with the following technologies:

Frontend:
    React & Next.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces
    TypeScript for static typing and maintainable code
    Tailwind CSS for utility-first, flexible styling
    pnpm for faster, more efficient package management

Backend:
    Java with Spring Boot for scalable and robust backend services
    Hibernate for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and database interaction
    MySQL for reliable and performant database management
In addition to my technical work, I also played a key role in customer support, working directly with users to troubleshoot issues, gather feedback, and ensure a smooth experience with the product. To stay organized and ensure efficient project delivery, I used Linear for project management and time tracking.

🛠️ Technical Skills

Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript
Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate
Databases: MySQL
Dev Tools: pnpm, Git, Postman, Linear
Project Management: Linear (for project tracking, task management, and time tracking)
🌍 Outside of Code

When I'm not coding, you can find me either:

Playing Table Tennis – A fun way to stay active and challenge myself!
Watching Films – I love exploring different genres, from classics to the latest releases.
